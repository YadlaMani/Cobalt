<h1 align="center" id="title">Cobalt</h1>

<p id="description">As developers a huge problem we face while working with codebases is that it becomes a time consuming process for us to go through thousands of lines of code and understand them. Our solution to this problem resolves this issue in a very simple way. All you need to do is paste the GitHub link of the repository which you want to understand. In order to tackle this problem we used artificial intelligence which gives you the power to understand the repository just by pasting its GitHub link. At first it gives you an overview of the project and displays all the files within the repository. From this you can select any file which you want to further understand and each and every function from the file which you select will be explained in detail. Another problem we face while developing multiple applications is that many a times the code which we write in one application can be used for implementing functionality in another application. Hence the need arises for us to store these code snippets and use them whenever necessary. ‚Ä®‚Ä®So we have created a very secure snippet storing system. Here we have implemented a machine learning algorithm through which you can search for a particular code snippet using information from the title description and the tags which you associate with the code snippet.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   AI-Driven Insights: üß† Cobalt automatically generates detailed explanations for code snippets enhancing developers' understanding and comprehension of complex logic and algorithms.
*   Efficient Codebase Utilization: ‚ôª By analyzing code patterns and usage Cobalt helps developers identify opportunities for code reuse optimization and refactoring leading to more efficient and maintainable codebases.
*   Secure Code Vault: üîê Cobalt provides a secure repository known as the Code Vault where developers can safely store their code snippets along with detailed descriptions and annotations. Utilizing advanced encryption techniques and access controls the Code Vault ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive code assets.
*   Intelligent Search Functionality: üîç Searching for specific code snippets within a large codebase can be a daunting task. Cobalt simplifies this process with its intelligent search functionality allowing developers to quickly locate relevant snippets based on tags descriptions or code similarities.
*   Comprehensive AI and Machine Learning Integration: ü§ñ Cobalt seamlessly integrates AI and machine learning technologies throughout its features from generating insights to powering intelligent search and recommendation systems. This comprehensive integration enhances developer productivity and streamlines the code management process.
